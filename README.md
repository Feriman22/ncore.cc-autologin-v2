dyndns-autologin
================

> If you would like to maintain your free Dyn account, you must log into your account once a month. Note that using an update client will no longer suffice for this monthly login. You will still continue to get email alerts every 30 days if your email address is current. Failure to login once per month will result in expiration and loss of your hostname.

No thanks.
